- [ ] Research load cell amplifier alternatives (HX711 vs ADS1232)
- [ ] Create **prototype wiring diagram** (Fritzing or similar)
- [ ] Order remaining components (NFC module, jumper wires, breadboard, power supply)
- [ ] Update requirements specification document

### Deliverables
- [Hardware Setup Phase 1](../docs/hardware-setup.png)
- [Wiring diagrams](../docs/wiring-diagram.png)
- [Requirements specification document v2](../docs/requirements-specification-v2.pdf)

---

## **Week 5 – Hardware Assembly & Phase 1 Implementation**
### Objectives
- Build basic weight measurement system
- Achieve core functionality

### Tasks
- [ ] Assemble **Load Cell + HX711 + ESP32 display**
- [ ] Write basic code to:
   - [ ] Initialize HX711
   - [ ] Calibrate load cell
   - [ ] Show weight on ESP32 display
- [ ] Test accuracy with known weights
- [ ] Debug and document setup in GitHub Wiki

### Deliverables
- Working load cell measurement system
- Calibration procedures
- [Basic firmware code](../smart-inventory-pallete-phase-1/)
- Documentation in GitHub Wiki

---

## **Week 6 – NFC Integration**
### Objectives
- Integrate NFC vehicle identification system
- Test module with ESP32

### Tasks
- [x] Planned to use **PN532 module**, but unavailable, so replaced with **HW-033 NFC reader**
- [x] Set up NFC reader hardware and code to read card/tag UID
- [x] Tested output on ESP32 serial monitor
- [ ] Verification pending — current output shows unreadable characters (␀, �, etc.)

### Deliverables
- NFC reader setup with ESP32
- [Initial test code](../phase2-nfc-system/)
- Documentation of hardware change (PN532 → HW-033)
- Identified issue with unreadable card data requiring further debugging

---

## **Week 7 – Combined Hardware System**
### Objectives
- Combine load cells and NFC system on ESP32
- Build hardware structure

### Tasks
- [x] Designed and assembled **hardware structure**
- [x] Connected **two load cells with HX711 modules** to ESP32
- [x] Tested both load cells with ESP32 firmware
- [ ] Accuracy issues observed — still under improvement
- [ ] Plan to refine calibration and filtering in Week 8

### Deliverables
- Combined hardware structure
- [Initial integration tests with dual load cells](../phase-3-combined-hardware/)
- Documentation of test results and challenges
